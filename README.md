# chat-gpt-translator-extension
chrome extension to use chat gpt translator to translate text on screen to english

click on the extension icon in the toolbar to begin translating. Need to set chat gpt api-key via extension settings. uses gpt-turbo-3 model.
Extension skeleton was generated with gpt4, and much of the extension code comes from https://github.com/CabbageSlices/gpt-english-translator, but modified to work 
as a bowser extension instead.
